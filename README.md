# The Lands of the Titan Minecraft Mod

This is a in progress Fabric Minecraft Mod meant to bring the world of the Demon Realm and the Boiling Isles from Disney's "The Owl House" to Minecraft.

### Current Features (Some may not be reflected on the curseforge page):
- A demon realm dimension including
    - 24 Different Biomes (Some more fleshed out than others)
    - Five different tree/wood types
    - Bone structures generating on the land
    - New flowers and other plants
    - A variety of stones and bricks including titanstone, titan marrow, titan's bone and more
- Some food and ingredient items
- Witch's wool and coven guard armor sets
### Upcoming Features:
- Improvements to the demon realm dimension and world generation including:
    - A fleshed out titans blood caves biome with titans blood dripstones
    - A flesh caves biomes including caves of fleshy tendrils and blocks of flesh with blinking eyes in them, filled by occasional pools of red water
    - A frosted forest biome to give the Demon Realm an equivelant to the snowy taiga biome in Vanilla Minecraft
    - Larger structures and more variety in the bone structures which spawn throughout the demon realm
    - More plant variety and detail throughout the world.
- Adding "boiling" rain and water (essentially making water in the demon realm damage you, possibly a new enchanment too lessening the effect)
- Glyphs, glyph books, and a glyph crafting and upgrading system
- New food sources, crops, harvestable plants, and mobs with edible drops, including:
    - Bilefruit (a cactus fruit growing on bile cacti in the palm stings biome)
    - Potatoe crops (a foot shaped potatoe crop based on an item from "The Owl House: Witch's Apprentice)
    - Crabapple (a mob combing the crab and apple together, dropping an edible crab apple, can be combined with a stick and sugar to make a candy crab apple)
    - Griffin eggs (found in nests, probably wont add the actual mob for a bit)
    - Firebee honey and firebees
    - Demon Meat (Dropped by most biped and beast demons)
    - Insect guts (Dropped by insect demons)
    - Calamari (Dropped by squids and will be used in the future)
    - Whatever else I can think of at the time
- New mobs to add a challenge to the world and be food sources including:
    - Woodland demons (feral beast demons found in the forests, representing the large variety of beast demons that exist in the Owl House, will drop demon meat)
    - Rogue abominations
    - Snaggleback
    - Lost spirit
    - Firebees
    - Probably some more, I have a long list of mob ideas
- Ruined demon realm portals, which can be restored and opened by titan's blood, which can rarely bee found in the overworld

Once I add the features above, I will release the beta version of the mod, and deem it as playable, right now this mod is more of a "sneak peak" for whats to come, you can download it on curseforge and run the command `/execute in toh:demon_realm run tp ~ ~ ~` to enter the demon realm and see, but it is not playable, and still deep in development.
